     * Apparently it uses something called the "inverse leaky bucket" algorithm.
     * Basically the premise is that you have several buckets for each
     * resource request.
     *
     * When the user makes a request, this function is called, letting
     * the bucket determine if the user has made too many requests.
     *
     * A bucket has a certain capacity of "tokens", which is taken from
     * every time a request is made. The cost of the request is usually
     * 1 "token", though this can be configured. It will throw an exception
     * if the user tries to take more than what is allotted.
     *
     * If I may use a more apt but slightly less tasteful analogy,
     * it's basically spoon theory.
